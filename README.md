## How To Use

Use the 36 dropdown menus to select plants for each plot, or use the 'Fill All' button and dropdown in the lower right to fill all plots with a certain plant.

Hover over each plot to see statistics such as what is currently planted, its effects, effect/aging multipliers, weed/fungus repellent, and possible plants that can grow in the plot next tick and the chances of each

Switch the soil type using the radio buttons below the plots.

**After making changes, use the 'Recalculate' button to see the new effects of the garden layout.**

## Known Issues

This simulator uses tkinter for the gui, which is great for portability, but is not very responsive. You may need to click the 'Recalculate' button a few times to update the effects.

OS X may not display the tooltips for plot info correctly, click around and move your mouse some and it may show up.
